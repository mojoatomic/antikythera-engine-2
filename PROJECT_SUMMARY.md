```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
cd antikythera-engine
npm install
npm start
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## ✨ Key Features

### Three Historically Accurate Faces

1. **Front Face** - The star of the show
   - All 7 visible celestial bodies (Sun, Moon, 5 planets)
   - Concentric orbital rings
   - Egyptian calendar outer ring
   - Zodiac with 12 signs
   - Realistic moon phases
   - Glowing sun effect

2. **Back Upper Face** - Long-term calendar
   - Metonic 19-year spiral
   - Callippic 76-year sub-dial
   - Year position markers

3. **Back Lower Face** - Eclipse predictor
   - Saros 223-month spiral
   - Eclipse type glyphs (☉☽)
   - Exeligmos 54-year sub-dial
   - Next eclipse countdown

### Five Beautiful Themes

- **Ancient Bronze** (default) - Weathered with blue backdrop
- **Restored Bronze** - Polished golden finish
- **Steampunk** - Brass with dark wood
- **Minimal** - Clean modern lines
- **Dark Mode** - OLED-friendly green

### Three Layout Modes

- **Gallery** - All three faces side-by-side
- **Hero** - Single large front face
- **Focus** - One at a time with navigation

### Interactive Controls

- Date/time picker (jump to any date)
- Animation (watch planets move)
- Layout switcher
- Theme switcher
- Keyboard shortcuts (arrows, spacebar)

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Backend: Dead Simple
- Node.js + Express
- Single wrapper class around astronomy-engine
- Clean REST endpoints
- No database needed

### Frontend: Component-Based
- Three face components (self-contained)
- Theme system (CSS variables)
- Layout system (CSS grid)
- Pure Canvas API (no frameworks)

### Why This Works

1. astronomy-engine provides the ephemeris calculations
2. Components are isolated and reusable
3. Themes are defined via CSS variables
4. Layouts are CSS classes
5. No build step — open in a browser

## 🎨 Design Principles

### Visual
- Historically accurate representations
- Beautiful enough to leave running
- Educational but not clinical
- Multiple viewing contexts supported

### Technical
- No frameworks (maximum simplicity)
- Component-based (easy to extend)
- Theme system (instant visual changes)
- API-driven (data separate from display)

### User Experience
- Works immediately (no configuration)
- Multiple themes (personal preference)
- Multiple layouts (different use cases)
- Animation (watch it come alive)

## 💡 Use Cases

### Museum Display
- Gallery layout on wide screen
- Ancient Bronze theme
- Educational ambient display

### Office Art
- Hero layout showing front face
- Minimal or Steampunk theme
- Beautiful background display

### Educational Tool
- Focus layout with navigation
- Any theme
- Step through faces explaining each

### Planetarium
- Gallery layout
- Dark Mode theme
- Supplement to sky shows

### Home Screensaver
- Any layout
- Cycle through themes
- Animation running

## 🔧 Extension Points

### Easy to Add

1. **New Themes** - Just CSS variables
2. **New Layouts** - Just CSS grid
3. **New Components** - Follow existing pattern
4. **New Data** - Extend API endpoints

### Examples You Could Add

- **Olympic Games indicator** (on Back Upper)
- **Planetary conjunctions panel**
- **Eclipse visibility map**
- **Custom date presets** (solstices, equinoxes)
- **3D moon rendering** (WebGL)
- **Sound effects** (ambient space sounds)

## 📊 Technical Stack

### Backend
- Node.js 18+
- Express 4.x
