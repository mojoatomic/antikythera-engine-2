## 🌑 BACK LOWER FACE: The Eclipse Predictor

**What it shows:** Saros cycle for predicting eclipses

│  Saros Cycle 145                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Features:**
- Spiral with eclipse type glyphs (☉☽)
- Predicts when similar eclipses will occur
- Shows solar/lunar eclipse alternation
- Exeligmos refinement (triple Saros = 54 years)
- Live countdown to next eclipse

**Historical Note:**
The Saros cycle was known to ancient Babylonians and Greeks. After one 
Saros cycle (18 years, 11 days), eclipses repeat with similar geometry.

**What you can observe:**
- Current position in Saros cycle
- Type of next eclipse (solar or lunar)
- Days until next eclipse
- Pattern of eclipse repetition

## 🎯 Why These Three Faces?

The original Antikythera mechanism had exactly these three main faces:

1. **Front** - Immediate astronomical positions (where are things NOW?)
2. **Back Upper** - Long-term calendar (what lunar month is it?)
3. **Back Lower** - Eclipse prediction (when's the next eclipse?)

Together, they answered the three most important questions for ancient 
astronomers, farmers, and calendar-makers:
- Where are the planets and moon? (navigation, astrology)
- What date is it in the lunar calendar? (religious festivals)
- When will the next eclipse occur? (astronomical events)

## 🎨 Visual Design Elements

**Concentric Circles** (Front Face)
- Represent different orbital distances
- Inner bodies move faster (Mercury is swift)
- Outer bodies move slower (Saturn is sluggish)

**Archimedean Spirals** (Back Faces)
- Uniform spacing as they spiral outward
- Represent cycles that repeat but advance
- Ancient Greek mathematical achievement

**Color Coding**
- Gold/Yellow: Sun, primary pointers
- Silver/White: Moon
- Red: Mars (god of war)
- Traditional planetary associations

**Pointer Styles**
- Thickness indicates importance
- Glow effects for luminous bodies (Sun)
- Phase rendering for Moon

## 🔄 Animation

When you hit "Play", watch:

**Front Face:**
- Moon zips around zodiac (~29.5 days/orbit)
- Mercury darts through signs (~88 days/orbit)
- Venus glides majestically (~225 days/orbit)
- Mars marches steadily (~687 days/orbit)
- Jupiter moves slowly (~12 years/orbit)
- Saturn crawls (~29 years/orbit)

**Back Upper:**
- Pointer spirals outward over 19 years
- Callippic sub-dial advances through 76-year cycle

**Back Lower:**
- Pointer moves through eclipse prediction cycle
- Eclipse glyphs show where eclipses will occur
- Counter shows approaching eclipse

**Speed up** the animation to see planetary conjunctions and eclipse 
patterns emerge!

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Gallery layout** to see all three faces and understand how 
   they relate to each other

2. **Use Hero layout** for the front face on a large screen - 
   the planetary motion is mesmerizing

3. **Try Dark Mode theme** on OLED displays for true blacks and 
   vibrant colors

4. **Animate through a full year** to watch the Moon complete 
   12-13 cycles through zodiac

5. **Jump to eclipse dates** (check NASA's eclipse calendar) to 
   see how the Saros spiral predicted them

6. **Watch retrograde motion** - Mars, Jupiter, Saturn appear 
   to move backward periodically
