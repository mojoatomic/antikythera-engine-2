Add lunar nodes calculation with 18.6 year precession cycle

- Implement getLunarNodes() method in engine
- Calculate ascending and descending node positions
- Track 18.613 year (6798.375 day) nodal precession cycle
- Add retrograde motion rate (-19.34 degrees/year)
- Calculate days until next node passage
- Add lunar nodes to getState() response
- Include lunar nodes in /api/display mechanical steppers

Features:
- Ascending/descending node positions in ecliptic degrees
- Progress through current 18.6 year cycle (0-1 and 0-360 degrees)
- Motion rate for stepper motor control (-0.053 degrees/day)
- Next node passage prediction with type (ascending/descending)
- Historically authentic to Antikythera mechanism

Eclipse prediction capability: Nodes are critical for eclipse forecasting,
as eclipses only occur when Sun/Moon/Earth align near the nodes.
