## Appendix: ASCL Entry Example

Here's what your final ASCL entry might look like:

```
Antikythera Engine
ASCL ID: ascl:2510.042
Language: JavaScript
Registered: October 2025

Antikythera Engine calculates real-time positions of celestial bodies 
(Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) with NASA-validated 
sub-10-arcsecond precision. The system provides structured outputs for 
both digital visualization and physical mechanism control, recreating 
the computational capabilities of the ancient Antikythera mechanism 
using modern astronomical calculations.

Validated against NASA JPL HORIZONS with typical errors of 1.4 arcseconds, 
the software serves astronomy educators, planetarium operators, and 
historical astronomy researchers. The API supports educational 
demonstrations, planetarium displays, and physical orrery control systems.
